					<p class= "content"> There is interesting history all around us – everywhere we go – but we just don’t know it. HistoryTracks brings to life the hidden history around us. With your help, we identify interesting stories from the past, place them on a map, and narrate them into 3-5 minute podcasts. 

HistoryTracks is organized around “Projects” that are focused on either geography (e.g. Rowayton, CT) or topic (e.g. Jazz)  Explore some of the tracks from our first project (Rowayton, CT) . Or Get Involved by telling us about a great historical story or becoming a HistoryTracks  ambassador and tracking down some great stories in your hometown or according to your interests.

Become a HistoryTracks Ambassador and help us tag and narrate interesting historical sites in your neighborhood or according to your interests (e.g. Jazz History Sites, Civil War Sites, etc.) Or even if you have just one great story to tell us, we want to hear about it. For inclusion into HistoryTracks, a historical story must meet the following criteria: 
1.)  It must be true! (…or perceived to be true) 
2.) It must be historically relevant! (…not where you had lunch) 
3.) It must be educational! (…give us some historical context…) 
4.) It must be interesting/entertaining! (…not boring)
